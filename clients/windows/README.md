# Fileway（栖卷）Windows

Windows 11 x64 native client, using .NET 10, WinUI 3 and the existing Go client core. The application is unpackaged and self-contained; it launches directly as an EXE. There is no WebView in the main interface.

## Toolchain and isolation

The initial verified development toolchain is .NET SDK 10.0.401, Windows App SDK 2.5.1, Windows SDK BuildTools 10.0.26100.9169, winapp CLI 0.7.1 and Go 1.26.6. WinUI source was generated using Microsoft's `Microsoft.WindowsAppSDK.WinUI.CSharp.Templates` 0.0.7-alpha; the template generator is separate from the stable application framework. The actual template options are obtained from `dotnet new winui --help`.

`eng/Use-WindowsEnvironment.ps1` selects project-specific toolchains, caches, build output, data and temporary directories in the current PowerShell process. It does not update global environment variables, install Visual Studio, enable Developer Mode, register certificates or modify Android SDKs.

```powershell
.\eng\Install-WindowsTools.ps1 -ToolsRoot <isolated-tools>
. .\eng\Use-WindowsEnvironment.ps1 -ToolsRoot <isolated-tools> -ArtifactsRoot <external-artifacts>
.\eng\Build-Windows.ps1 -ToolsRoot <isolated-tools> -ArtifactsRoot <external-artifacts> -Configuration Debug
```

The installer script downloads fixed official tool archives, checks published hashes and extracts them into the selected directory. Incomplete downloads are retained for resume; no system installer is run. Defaults use sibling directories relative to the checkout, so the scripts also work with explicit temporary CI roots.

Deep checkout/tool paths can exceed native XAML compiler path limits. Pass an explicit short, externally owned `-NuGetPackagesRoot <path>` to environment/build/test scripts when needed. It is propagated through nested scripts and never changes global NuGet or Windows settings.

Build-Windows builds the Go Host first, embeds the actual Git commit and records dirty state and executable SHA-256 in `host-build.json`. It then copies the matching Host and manifest beside the application. A direct app build without these prerequisites fails explicitly.

The EXE is produced under `<external-artifacts>\bin\Fileway.App\x64\Debug\net10.0-windows10.0.26100.0\win-x64`. Run it with that directory as its working directory. Publishing also stays under the external artifact root. A successful build is not proof of native launch, media support or a clean installation.

## Component boundaries

- `Fileway.App`: native windows and view models, input, theme and accessibility.
- `Fileway.Core`: immutable account/resource identities, typed service contracts and use cases; no WinUI dependency.
- `Fileway.Infrastructure`: process IPC, persistence, credentials, local files and diagnostics.
- `Fileway.Playback`: native media bindings and playback lifecycle.
- `host`: separate Go executable referencing `clients/shared/core`, following [private IPC v1](docs/ipc-v1.md).

## First local preview

The first native preview supports password/noauth connections, directory browsing, sorting and filtering the current directory, file details, a native image window, and libmpv video playback with pause, seek and volume. The A/B/C appearance selector compares provisional visual directions inside the native app; it does not save a product-wide design decision.

This preview uses explicit direct connections, including routes supplied by the system Tailscale installation. System/PAC proxies, embedded tsnet, persistent credentials, transfers, file mutations and external-player integration are not included in this first slice. They remain separate application work. The main interface contains no placeholder actions for those features.

The Go auxiliary process is managed by the app: it starts locally, uses private inherited control pipes, and exits with the parent. Process management prevents orphan processes and supports crash recovery. Server authorization continues to enforce the existing account permissions.

## Media and packaging

Native media binaries stay outside Git. `vendor/mpv/runtime-packages.lock.json` records the exact MSYS2 UCRT64 packages and PE imports selected for the preview. `resolve-runtime.py` resolves the runtime into an external artifact root; `probe-runtime.py` inspects the actual mpv/FFmpeg build, including rejection of an enabled nonfree configuration. These scripts require Python and `pefile` in the isolated dependency environment. Runtime licenses and binary provenance accompany the local payload; corresponding-source completeness and public redistribution approval remain separate release gates.

```powershell
.\eng\Build-Windows.ps1 -ArtifactsRoot <external-artifacts> -Configuration Release -MediaRuntimeRoot <pinned-runtime-directory> -Publish
.\eng\Package-Preview.ps1 -PublisherInput <external-artifacts>\publish\Release\win-x64 -ArtifactsRoot <external-artifacts>
```

The runtime is copied under `media` beside the application. Packaging consumes an existing publish directory and creates an unsigned ZIP and a current-user NSIS installer; it does not rebuild, install or publish a GitHub release. Keep the whole extracted directory together and run `Fileway.App.exe`. See [installer behavior](installer/README.md).

Visual direction, representative native slice and final product acceptance remain separate gates. Build and runtime evidence belongs outside Git. A successful native media probe does not prove visible first frames, audible sound, HDR, all codecs, multiple monitors or a clean installation.

Windows code uses GPL-3.0, consistent with the shared core. Existing backend and Android licenses and identifiers remain unchanged. Third-party binaries require their own pinned provenance, notices and corresponding source/build materials before distribution.
