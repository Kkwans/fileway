# Windows private control protocol v1

The WinUI application starts the fixed, co-located Go Host executable with private inherited stdin/stdout pipes. There is no control TCP listener. The parent owns a kill-on-close Job Object. stderr contains only bounded, redacted diagnostics; stdout is exclusively framed protocol data. The shared Go module remains the implementation of authentication, network routing and resource leases.

## Frames and identity

Each frame is an unsigned 32-bit **little-endian** byte count followed by that many UTF-8 JSON bytes. Length must be between 1 and 16,777,216 inclusive, checked before allocation. EOF, truncated frames, invalid UTF-8 and malformed envelopes fail the connection. No request body is logged.

```json
{"protocolMajor":1,"protocolMinor":0,"requestId":"unique-id","generation":0,"op":"open","parameters":{"baseUrl":"https://example.invalid","network":"direct"}}
```

- Major must equal 1; unsupported major returns `ProtocolMismatch` without invoking the core. Minor 0 is the initial contract; optional features are negotiated in `init`.
- requestId is a nonempty ASCII identifier of at most 128 bytes, unique among accepted outstanding requests. generation is a nonnegative signed 64-bit integer echoed unchanged. Neither grants authority.
- `session`, when present, is a top-level immutable core session handle. `parameters` is an object with operation-specific core fields. It may not contain `op`, `session` or `requestId`; the Host supplies those fields.
- `init` is required before business operations. Its result contains `protocolMajor`, `protocolMinor`, `coreProtocol` (currently 1), `hostVersion`, `buildCommit`, Go/module build metadata and explicit Host capabilities. A missing build commit is reported as `unknown`, never invented.
- `health` is a Host-only operation. `cancel` has `parameters.targetRequestId`; it cancels the accepted target, including queued work. The cancel request has its own distinct requestId. Cancellation acknowledgement does not assert that a mutation was undone.
- `shutdown` is terminal for the Host even though the reusable shared Engine can initialize again. After the response, new business requests are rejected, accepted work is canceled/drained with a bound, and the Engine is shut down. Pipe EOF also initiates shutdown.

## Results and errors

```json
{"protocolMajor":1,"protocolMinor":0,"requestId":"unique-id","generation":0,"ok":false,"error":"request queue is full","errorInfo":{"code":"Busy","message":"request queue is full","retryable":true}}
```

Success has `ok:true` and a JSON `result` (including null). Failure preserves the core's existing `error` string and adds `errorInfo` with a stable `code`, safe message, optional `httpStatus` and `retryable`. Classification must use typed errors or actual HTTP status, never English string matching. A core error not yet typed is explicitly `CoreRejected` and not automatically retried; it is not guessed to be a network error.

Host codes include `ProtocolMismatch`, `HandshakeRequired`, `InvalidRequest`, `DuplicateRequest`, `Busy`, `Canceled`, `ResponseTooLarge`, `HostClosing`, `HostFailure` and `CoreRejected`. Higher-level HTTP responses retain their actual status/body as core results; the .NET adapter classifies authentication, authorization and business failures by status and typed server fields. Loss of a response to a dispatched mutation becomes `OutcomeUnknown` in its use case, never a generic automatic retry.

## Scheduling and cancellation

- At most 8 business operations run, with at most 64 additional accepted queued operations. Saturation returns `Busy` with matching identity; it does not block the reader.
- `cancel`, `close_session`, `health` and `shutdown` use a separate bounded control path so they can proceed while business workers are occupied. init is handled before business dispatch.
- Each accepted request produces at most one response. stdout writes are serialized, and returned frames are bounded. The reader keeps receiving cancellations while operations execute.
- The core's ordinary command limit remains approximately 1 MiB; the Host does not raise it or route file/media bytes through JSON. This first Windows client does not use the raw-body exception.
- A queued canceled request must not call the server. Completion already confirmed by the core survives a late cancel. Closing a session prevents queued requests from recreating or using that session.
- The .NET client drops obsolete presentation callbacks by generation but still records confirmed business results. Killing/restarting the Host invalidates every session and lease.

## Verification

The Host is tested with in-memory framed streams and a fake core boundary, plus a real subprocess integration test using the shared Engine and a local HTTP fixture. Cover length/UTF-8/truncation, handshake/version mismatch, duplicate identities, eight workers/64 queued saturation, cancellation while saturated, queued cancellation, session close, response bounds, EOF/shutdown and clean process exit. Never use personal server credentials in tests.
