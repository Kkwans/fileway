# Android external subtitle paths

The NAS picker and local SAF picker feed one `NativePlayer.addSubtitle` entry.
The authenticated lease or granted content URI supplies bytes; a media generation
and request number reject late reads after replacement, cancellation or subtitle off.
Changing external text/bitmap selection, delay or appearance does not reopen video.

| Format | Native rendering path |
| --- | --- |
| ASS / SSA | libass, preserving authored styles and embedded-media fonts |
| SRT / WebVTT / TTML / DFXP | Media3 parser, collected whole-file cues |
| SUP / PGS | Fileway display-set assembly plus Media3 PGS decoder |
| SMI / SAMI | SAMI timing/language parser, Android styled text, collected Media3 cues |

SAMI is parsed as millisecond sync points. Language classes become separate
selectable tracks with names/language codes from CSS metadata. Common paragraphs
apply to each language; source/speaker paragraphs persist until their next update.
Nonbreaking-space paragraphs clear text. The last event remains valid until a
later event or media end. Seek and positive/negative delay reuse the same complete
cue timeline, including while paused.

SAMI byte decoding accepts UTF-8/UTF-16 BOMs and an explicit charset declaration;
otherwise it requires valid UTF-8. It does not guess a legacy encoding from the
filename or replace invalid bytes silently. Paragraph HTML uses Android's text
conversion for inline formatting, not a WebView; scripts and remote images do not
execute or fetch resources. This does not implement every SAMI CSS/layout feature.

External reads are bounded at 16 MiB. Collected cues are bounded at 20,000 events
and 32 MiB in one media generation. All SAMI languages are validated and attached
as a single bundle, so a quota failure cannot select a partially loaded language set.
There are at most 32 SAMI language classes. Backward/invalid times are rejected.
Parser expressions must run on both JVM and Android ICU; their regex rules differ.

The maintained timing reference is Microsoft's
[SAMI 1.0 specification](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/dnacc/understanding-sami-1.0).
Tests use owned files. Parser tests are separate from installed frame/cue tests,
audible switching continuity, NAS/SAF permissions and actual HDR acceptance.
